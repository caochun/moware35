MoWare 2021 (11 edition)
[Compatible with MPS 2019.2 / jbr 11] 

MoWare Werkbank allows you to create business applications with more efficiency and 
more development speed. By seperating technical from fachlichem Java and relying on
the concepts from Domain Driven Design, users can focus on domain requirements instead 
of getting bogged down by technical framework issues .

MoWare Werkbank consists of a set of three domain specific languages (DSLâ€™s) 
to model the different aspects of business applications:
1. Persistance of aggregates and entities
2. UI/Application controllers to formulate user workflows and business logic
3. UI models with keywords like 'table' or 'form'. 

All three DSL's are technology - or better framework - independent. At the same time they are built on 
top of java. This allows the developer to create fachliche services in plain Java, using the common
for/while or if concepts. This is very important to convey the feeling of common java developing. 

MoWare Werkbank is depends heavily on the jetbrains MPS language workbench. All DSL concepts as well as all 
code generators and runtime environments are developed within MPS. Thus, all aspects of the tooling are 
explorable, understandable and changeable.
